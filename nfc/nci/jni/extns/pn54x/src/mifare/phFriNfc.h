/*
 * Completion Routine
 *
 * NFC-FRI components that work in an overlapped style need to provide a function that is compatible
 * to this definition.
 * It is mandatory to define such a routine for components that interact with other components up or
 * down the stack. Moreover, such components shall provide a function within their API to enable the
 * setting of the Completion Routine address and parameters.
 *
 *      First Parameter: Context
 *      Set to the address of the called instance (component instance context structure). For instance,
 *      a component that needs to give control to a component up the stack needs to call the completion
 *      routine of the upper component. The value to assign to this parameter is the address of
 *      the context structure instance of the called component. Such a structure usually contains all
 *      variables, data or state information a component member needs for operation. The address of the
 *      upper instance must be known by the lower (completing) instance. The mechanism to ensure that this
 *      information is present involves the structure phFriNfc_CplRt_t . See its documentation for
 *      further information.
 *
 *      Second Parameter: Status Value
 *      The lower layer hands over the completion status via this parameter. The completion
 *      routine that has been called needs to process the status in a way that is comparable to what
 *      a regular function return value would require.
 *
 *       The prototype of the component's Process(ing) functions has to be compatible to this
 *       function pointer declaration for components interacting with others. In other cases, where
 *       there is no interaction or asynchronous processing the definition of the Process(ing)
 *       function can be arbitrary, if present at all.
